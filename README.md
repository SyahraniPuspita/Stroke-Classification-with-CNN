# Stroke-Classification-with-CNN
This is a final project in the form of a system that can classify stroke diseases using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method with the Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) approach.

This system uses the CNN method and will use several architectures namely EfficientNetV2, ResNet50V2 and OzNet (custom architecture). The part that is indicated as the most influential to the decision of the intelligent system will be marked with the XAI approach with a certain color.
